# go-quick-1
My solutions to the Go problems
In this file, I will explain as clrarly as I can how to run the code to each of the problems in the first problems sheet.
All you need is the Go compiler installed on your device. You can get in installed here -  https://golang.org/dl/
And just open up your command line.

Step 1:
Clone this current repository using the git command:
git clone https://github.com/garyconnelly1/go-quick-1

Step 2:
Change directory to the go-quick-1 folder.
cd go-quick-1

Step 3:
compile the hello world file using the following command:
go build 01-helloWorld.go

Step 4:
Run the executable file produced.
./01-helloWorld.exe

Step 5:
Repeat steps 3 and 4, replacing the file names with the file name you wish to execute. For example:
./02-timeAndDateGo.go
